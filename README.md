# Starquest

Starquest is a web application developed using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as practice for translating designs into functional code. The final product will not be completely perfect due to a lack of original assets but will be as close as possible to the original. This project was created to hone UI development skills by implementing design concepts into a responsive and interactive web interface.

## Features

- Responsive UI design implementation
- Utilizes Vite for a fast development environment
- Built with React for component-based architecture
- Styled using Tailwind CSS for modern and customizable styling
